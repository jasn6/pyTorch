# Transforms allow for manipulation of data, mainly used to make data more suitable for training.

# TorchVision datasets have two transform parameters -transform to modfiy the features and
# -target_transform to modify the labels, it accepts callables containing the transformation logic

# For training we need the features as normalized tensors, and the labels as one-hot encoded tensors.
